The test-beam campaign at FTBF has been completed in the first week of July 2018 and the analysis of the TPC-prototype has been finalized. The results were presented at various internal meetings.\newline
We have acquired an X-ray tube setup with a gantry system that allows precisely positioned and controlled illumination of detectors with an almost mono-chromatic source. The devices will be arriving at SBU at the end of January.

The final installation of the evaporator equipment will be performed in the first quarter of 2019 and first commissioning of the system is planned thereafter.

We are planning on continuing the investigation of meta-materials suited for the application of Cherenkov photon detection. We are expecting the COMSOL-software we have purchased in January and need to familiarize ourselves with the operation of the software. Students will be returning by the end of January and we are expecting to model appropriate materials within the first two or three weeks in February.

We are working on making up the invitation of the Prof. Capasso from Harvard University to learn most about meta-materials.

Planned schedule:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Jan-Mar 2019 IBF measurements
\item[-] Jan-Apr 2019 Final evaporator installation
\item[-] Feb-May 2019 Simulation of meta-materials
\item[-] Apr-May 2019 Evaporator commissioning
\end{itemize}
