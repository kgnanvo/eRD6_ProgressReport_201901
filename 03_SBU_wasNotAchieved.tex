\subsubsection{Stony Brook University} 
We invited Prof. Capasso (Harvard University) for a seminar and visit at the facilities at SBU. Prof. Capasso is one of the world experts of meta-material studies and we were hoping to gain insight into the field of meta-materials and maybe collaborate with his group on this topic. The seminar was set to be at SBU on Nov. 9 but had to unfortunately be cancelled due to private commitments of Prof. Capasso on short notice. We have postponed the invitation and hope to make arrangements soon.
