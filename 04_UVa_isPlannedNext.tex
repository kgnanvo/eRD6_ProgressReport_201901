\subsubsection{University of Virginia} 
Our plans and R\&D goals for next cycle of FY19 are:
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \textbf{Large EIC-FT-GEM prototype:} Continue the analysis of the FTBF data. Present the results of the performances of the the prototype at MPGD2019 conferences in Spring 2019 and start preparing the draft for publication of these results in peer-reviewed journal.
%
\item \textbf{R\&D on $\mu$RWELL detector technology:} Continue the work on the design of a small cylindrical  $\mu$RWELL detector with FIT and TU. Procure a second 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm prototype with the R\&D focus on low mass and high resolution 2D readout strips patterns. We will also continue the study and characterization of our current small prototype and most importantly the performance of this new technology in high particle rate environment. 
%
\item \textbf{VMM readout Electronics:} Procure a small size VMM-based Scalable Readout System (SRS) if  a stable version of the FE cards are available and start testing this new  electronics with the our detectors to compare the performances of VMM-SRS readout system with the APV25 electronics.
%
\item \textbf{Draft paper on Chromium GEM (Cr-GEM) studies:}  Continue working on the draft  paper for the publication of the results in NIMA or TNS journal.
