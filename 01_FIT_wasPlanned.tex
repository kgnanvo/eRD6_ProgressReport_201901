\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Forward Tracker Prototype:} One goal for this funding period was to extract the performance characteristics of the low-mass prototype from the data that we hoped to collect at the Fermilab beam test and to present the results at conferences and in a publication. In addition, we wanted to perform additional measurements on the detector with X-rays at Florida Tech, e.g.\ gain curves.
%
\item \textbf{EIC Simulations:} Undergraduate Matt Bomberger was to continue his EIC simulations to investigate the impact that material budgets in the forward and backward regions will have on the overall EIC detector performance. Our goal was to have results from a realistic simulation of the forward tracker region by May 2019.
%
\item \textbf{$\mu$RWELL detector:} We planned to work closely with UVa on the design of a first prototype for a small cylindrical $\mu$RWELL detector. Finally, we were to assemble and commission a 10 $\times$ 10 cm$^2$ $\mu$RWELL prototype with zigzag-strip readout and characterize its performance using X-rays.
