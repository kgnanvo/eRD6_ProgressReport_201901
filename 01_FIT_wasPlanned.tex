\paragraph*{Forward Tracker Prototype:} Our main goal for the past six months was to assemble the new large, low-mass FT GEM detector with zigzag readout and to put it through a battery of quality control tests. We planned to work closely with the BNL and UVa groups to prepare for a joint forward tracker beam test at the Fermilab test beam facility in June/July 2018. We also hoped to procure a small (10$\times$10 cm$^2$) resistive micro-well detector from CERN during the next period to begin some basic R\&D on this detector technology for fast tracking in the barrel region of the EIC detector.

\paragraph*{EIC Simulations:} An undergraduate student, Matt Bomberger, was to begin work on EIC simulations for investigating the impact that material budgets in the forward and backward regions will have on the overall EIC detector performance. In the reporting period he was to familiarize himself with the EICroot simulation framework. We planned to send Matt to BNL in May or June to spend some time working directly with EICRoot expert Alexander Kiselev.
