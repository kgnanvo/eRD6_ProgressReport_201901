TU has not yet completed all of its goals for this current funding cycle. In regards to the hardware side, we have our third of four commercial triple-GEM detectors fully assembled, however we have not yet had time to start to fully characterize it (via cosmics/$^{55}$Fe). We also did not fully assemble the fourth and final commercial triple-GEM detector yet, because we wanted to wait until we tested the third GEM detector first, in case any alterations to the assembly process needed to be made. With the successful test of the third commercial triple-GEM detector, we are now ready to complete the assembly of the forth commercial triple-GEM detector. This will then be followed by testing and characterization of the detector.

TU also has not yet implemented a realistic digitization for the cylindrical shell MPGD operating in a $\mu$TPC mode, which prevents a realistic assessment of the tracking performance. This will be the main simulation focus of the remaining funding cycle.
