During the remaining time in this funding period, TU plans on finishing out the R\&D related to the commercial triple-GEM detectors. This includes assembling the triple-GEM stack of the fourth and last commercial GEM detector, and characterizing its performance along with the recently assembled third triple-GEM detector. The performance of both detectors will be assessed via cosmic and using an $^{55}$Fe source. This will complete the eRD3 carry over R\&D.

Additionally, TU will continue work on the simulating a MPGD cylindrical detector operating in a $\mu$TPC mode. In particular we will focus on implementing a realistic digitization scheme, which will be based on test beam results BNL acquired when testing a $\mu$TPC using a Compass readout. With the digitization scheme in place we can then assess accurate tracking performance of such a detector. Additionally we can then look at the tracking impact when including a TPC with the cylindrical MPGD shells, as well as integrating the forward MPGD tracking simulations that FIT is working on. This will allow us to study the global performance of the tracking detectors within the entire EIC phase space.
