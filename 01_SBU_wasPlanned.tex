It was planned to continue the installation of an electron-ion beam system into the evaporator at SBU.

We were also planning analyzing the data taken with a TPC prototype in a test-beam campaign in June/July 2018 at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) and starting up the IBF measurements.

Furthermore, we were planning to start investigating the properties of meta-materials that were obtained via optical transformation methods.
