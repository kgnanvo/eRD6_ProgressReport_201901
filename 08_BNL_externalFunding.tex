\subsection{Brookhaven National Lab} 
All scientific manpower at BNL would be provided by internal funding. However, technician and designer labor would need to be supported through EIC R\&D funds.   

Additional work on R\&D on Micropattern Detectors for EIC is also being provided by a BNL LDRD in collaboration with Saclay and Stony Brook. This is supporting our continued work on zig-zag readout with GEMs and Micromegas and we do not request any funding for this effort from EID R\&D funds. However, our proposed work on TPC R\&D for EIC would not be covered under LDRD funds.
