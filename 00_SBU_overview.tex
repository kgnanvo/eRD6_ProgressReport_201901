SBU is concentrating on the study of Ion Backflow (IBF) for a TPC, a possible candidate for the central tracker in at least one of the EIC detectors for an EIC. Furthermore, the TPC for sPHENIX has the same physical size when used in, e.g., the BeAST EIC detector. 

It has been shown that IBF will pose a problem in an EIC detector and that the ultimate EIC TPC device must do more than sPHENIX to achieve the same level of position distortion. Our approach is to investigate new structures in and around the multiplication stage that promise significant better performance when considering IBF.

SBU proposed in the latest funding cycle the investigation of a new detector concept that might allow to significantly enhance particle identification via the Cherenkov effect with the help of meta-materials.

SBU also is working on the final installation of a unit that allows to produce high quality large size mirrors for RICH applications. The project is ongoing and expected to be finalized in about two months.
