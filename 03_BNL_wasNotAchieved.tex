We have not yet measured the TPC prototype equipped with the Micromegas or micro-RWELL readouts since we've only fairly recently completed the assembly of the prototype equipped with GEMs and have not yet finished the measurements with this setup. However, we have recently received two zigzag PCB's, one coupled to a Micromegas, and the other coupled to a micro-RWELL. Preliminary testing of these boards has begun with further comissioning tests in planar detector configurations to follolw, before these boards are studied in the TPC prototype. In addition, we have not yet read out the TPC prototype with either the SAMPA or DREAM electronics mainly since the setup is new, but more so due to the fact that further work is required to read out these electronics through our data acquisition software.
