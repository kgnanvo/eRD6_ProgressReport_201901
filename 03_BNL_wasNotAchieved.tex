We were not able to complete the assembly of the cosmic ray telescope in time to make any useful measurements with it since we were preoccupied with preparing for and carrying out the beam test of the multi-zigzag PCB described earlier. We also were not able to complete the assembly of the compact TPC enclosure for the same reasons. However, we did in fact make good progress on both fronts and expect to have the assembly of the prototype TPC detector completed within the next few months and will also start using the telescope in earnest for the various tests mentioned earlier.
