The activity is progressing according to  planning.
Nevertheless, the milestone: "September 2018: 
The performance of the tests to establish 
the compatibility of the ND photocathodes
with the operation of MPGD-based photon detectors."
could not be fully achieved. Some puzzling aspects 
of the performance observed using THGEM
with ND photocathode require repeated exercises
of production and test before reaching final conclusions.
