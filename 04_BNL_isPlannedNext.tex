\subsubsection{Brookhaven National Lab} 

Our proposed R\&D activity for FY19 is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Utilize our small TPC prototype that was redesigned and rebuilt from our TPC/Cherenkov prototype (uses same field cage \& drift volume with a new, smaller and more compact enclosure that allows easy exchange of readout detector).
\item Test with Multistage GEM, $\mu$Megas, Hybrid GEM+$\mu$Megas and $\mu$RWELL readout.
\item Investigate various types of readout boards (including zigzags and other patterns) and different gases to optimize readout with each type of gain structure.
\item Carry out simulation studies for various readout patterns and gas combinations. 
\item Read out using SAMPA readout electronics currently being developed for sPHENIX and/or DREAM electronics.  Can also read out up to 128 ch  over limited drift range using our high resolution V1742 DRS system.
\item Measure spatial resolution and track resolution in a TPC operating mode using cosmic ray telescope in the lab and then in the test beam.
\item Can also study laser calibration of TPC drift region using our UV laser.

\end{itemize}

These plans are well aligned with our initial goals for this time period.
