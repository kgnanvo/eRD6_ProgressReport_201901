\subsubsection{Brookhaven National Lab} 

Our proposed R\&D activity for the next funding cycle is as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Tests with TPC prototype (study track reconstruction using cosmic rays ) 
\item Study track reconstruction in TPC prototype in the lab using cosmic ray telescope (position resolution, Neff) 
\item TPC electronics (SAMPA, DREAM)
\item Continue work on optimizing the production of zigzag readouts in parallel with the eRD6 R\&D program 
\end{itemize}

General goals for the future

\begin{itemize}
\item Tests with TPC prototype (try different zigzag readout patterns; different avalanche schemes; gas choice; charge spread, attachment, and IBF measurements) 
\item Start work on simulation studies of the response of various zigzag readout patterns in combination with different detector gases and avalanche technologies.  
\item Study production of "laser tracks" in TPC drift region using our UV laser to ionize gas.

\end{itemize}

These plans are well aligned with our initial goals for this time period.
