\subsubsection{Brookhaven National Lab} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Tests with TPC prototype (1D and 2D zigzag readouts; avalanche scheme; gas choice; and measure charge spread, attachment, and IBF) 
\item Study track reconstruction in TPC prototype using cosmic ray telescope (position resolution, Neff) 
\item TPC electronics (SAMPA, DREAM)
\item Continue work on zigzag readouts in parallel 
\item Carry out simulation studies for various readout patterns and gas combinations. 
\item Study production of "laser tracks" in TPC drift region using our UV laser to ionize gas.

\end{itemize}
