\subsubsection{INFN Trieste} 
\textbf{Activity planned in 
period July 2018 - December 2018}
\par
Two R\&D items were foreseen in this period:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Concerning  the novel prototype of 
\textbf{single photon detector by MPGD technologies with 
miniaturized 
pad-size} the completion  of 
a set-up adequate for test beam studies, the test-beam exercise and the initial analysis of the data collected at the test beam;
\item
Concerning  the \textbf{innovative photocathode 
based on NanoDiamond (ND) particles}, the continuation 
of the initial studies to understand the 
compatibility of this photocathode type with the 
operation in gaseous detectors and, in 
particular, in MPGD-based photon detectors.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{2018 milestones}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
September 2018: The completion of the laboratory characterization 
of the photon detector with miniaturized
pad-size.
\item
September 2018: The performance of the tests to establish 
the compatibility of the ND photocathodes
with the operation of MPGD-based photon detectors.
\end{itemize}
