There are no technical issues that would impede our progress towards reaching our goals for this funding cycle.    

More broadly, up to this point we have concentrated our efforts on optimizing various forms of readout for planar (short drift) detectors. A critical issue we face is the optimization of the readout of the TPC, which includes significant variability in the sizes of charge clouds impinging the readout plane due to transverse diffusion over relatively long drift distances. Specifically, the particular zigzag patterns employed and the GEM field configurations that were found to be well suited for planar detectors are likely not optimal for TPC applications. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate the response of the TPC for different zigzag patterns and operating parameters for the avalanche scheme. This includes investigating the implementation of MPGD's other than GEM's, including Micromegas and micro-RWELL.
