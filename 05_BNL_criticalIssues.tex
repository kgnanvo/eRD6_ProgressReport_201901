The most critical issue we wish to study is the performance of the various forms of readout in a TPC in an operating mode that is optimized for EIC. This is significantly different than what has been studied with these types of MPGDs and readout boards in eRD3/eRD6 in the past since the spatial resolution is affected by the diffusion of the primary ionization across the drift volume. One therefore wants to study the effect of this when used in combination with various forms of gas amplification devices and readout structures. In addition, the time resolution of the detector and the readout plays an important role as well, which is not so important in a simple planar detector. Finally, since the amount of ion feedback for a TPC operating at EIC will mostly likely be much less than for a TPC operating in a heavy ion environment such as sPHENIX and ALICE, the design of those TPCs will not necessarily be optimal for a TPC for EIC, and we would therefore like to determine the optimal design and operating conditions for the electron ion collider environment.
